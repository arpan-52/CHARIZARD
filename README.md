This a highly automated radio interferometric imaging routine, which process the whole band data by treating each spw independently. 
Imrovements...
1. Band specific spw making or asking the user for number of spws..
2. More modularity in selecting which jobs to perform.
3. Adding a function which can automatically flag bad antennas.  - Done
